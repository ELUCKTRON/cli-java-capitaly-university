# CapitalyGame

### üß© Game Overview

This CLI-based simulation models the Capitaly game with simplified rules and focuses on:
- Different types of **fields**: property, service, and lucky.
- Players using **strategy-based behavior**.
- A **cyclical board** to simulate movement.
- Basic **game economy** (buying, paying, winning conditions).

### üéÆ Game Mechanics

#### Fields
- **Property Field**
  - Can be bought for **1000**.
  - If a player steps on their own property again, they can build a **house** for **4000**.
  - Stepping on another player's property:
    - Pay **500** (if no house).
    - Pay **2000** (if house exists).
- **Service Field**
  - Pay a fixed amount to the **bank** (defined in the input file).
- **Lucky Field**
  - Gain a fixed amount from the **bank** (defined in the input file).

#### Players
- Start with **10000** money.
- Elimination: If a player cannot pay required money, they are eliminated, and their properties are released.

#### Player Strategies
- **Greedy**: Always buys if they have enough money.
- **Careful**: Only spends at most half their money in any round.
- **Tactical**: Skips every second chance to buy.

### üìÑ Input

The game reads from a **text input file** that includes:
1. Number of fields and their types (plus price for service/lucky).
2. Number of players with name and strategy.
3. A sequence of dice rolls (for reproducibility and testing).

Example input structure:
```
5
property
lucky 200
service 300
property
property
3
Alice Greedy
Bob Careful
Charlie Tactical
4 6 2 1 5 3 4 ...
```
